# Lemon Bot

My first attempt at making a Discord bot.

## How to run

Generate the ts code files. In vscode you can do it via:
```
Terminal > + button > Run Task > tsc watch: tsconfig.json
```
(This will enable a watch that will turn each ts file into a js file and put it into /out folder)

Then run:
```
node out/index.js
```
